Commands for exercise 5 and 6:

New-Item -Path . -Name "filename.txt" -ItemType "File" <- this command is for creating new files inside the repo through teh git bash console. I've used powershell of windows.

for example:

New-Item -Path . -Name "HiChat.txt" -ItemType "File"

notepad.exe HiChat.txt <- THis file opens the notepad app of Windows and lets you use it for modify files 

after that, you make a commit and then you push the archives to the online repository.
